        Day-1:  IWhat is HTML?
        HTML is a set of instructions that tell a web browser how to display a web page. It's made up of a series of elements, represented by tags (<>), which are used to wrap around content and apply meaning to it.
        
        Basic HTML Structure
        A basic HTML document consists of the following elements:
        
        - <!DOCTYPE html>: The document type declaration, which tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
        - <html>: The root element of the HTML document.
        - <head>: The head section, which contains metadata about the document.
        - <title>: The title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar.
        - <body>: The body section, which contains the content of the web page.
        
        HTML Tags
        HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Here are some common HTML tags:
        
        Headings
        - <h1>: The main heading of the page.
        - <h2>: A subheading.
        - <h3>: A sub-subheading.
        
        Text Formatting
        - <p>: A paragraph of text.
        - <b>: Bold text.
        - <i>: Italic text.
